Sethealth allows to load 3D models (geometry) into an existing workspace. Imagine, for example, viewing a custom implant model over
a CT. Loading, generating and serializing geometries can be done through the `geometry` module.

## Workspace

Here the `workspace` has its own role too. A workspace contains a list of geometry models:

```js
workspace.geometries
```

This array (initially empty), can be modified in order to append geometries into an existing workspace. UI components will
then render the 3D model over the medical resource.


```tsx
// Load medical data
const medHandler = await sethealth.med.loadFromSource({
  type: "nrrd",
  input:
    "https://public1-eu-sethealth.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/public/ankle.nrrd.gz",
})[0];

// Creating workspace from medical data
const workspace = await sethealth.workspace.create(medHandler);

// Load a geometry (from a .stl) file
const geometries = await sethealth.geometry.loadFromSource({
  type: "stl",
  input:
    "https://public1-eu-sethealth.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/public/geometry/fibula.stl.gz",
});

// Append the geometry to the workspace
workspace.addGeometry(geometries);

this.setState({ workspace });
```

As shown here, the `workspace` is created with the `MedHandler` and then the `Geometry` is attached to `workspace.geometries`.


## Render a Geometry

The attached geometry can then be visualized with the component `<set-view-geometry>`.

```tsx
<SetViewGeometry workspace={myWorkspace} />
```

The only required field is the `workspace`. For further information about this component, [check out the component docs](../components/set-view-geometry).
