In the [previous guide](./visualize-tomography), we learned how to use the `<set-view-volumetric>` component to render a [CT (computed tomography)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CT_scan) in 3D directly in the browser.
This component comes with 4 rendering modes (or shaders):

```html
<set-view-volumetric shader="max-intensity"></set-view-volumetric>
```

- `"basic"`
- `"lighting"`
- `"shadows"`
- `"max-intensity"`

Even though this 4 shaders should cover most of the use cases, it's possible to go low level
and write a custom one for special use cases or just experimenting new ways of rendering your data. 

Sethealth API makes writing this volumetric shaders extremelly easy, by abstracting away all the setup required to get 
a production-ready ray caster.


## Anatomy of a volumetric ray caster

A computed tomography can be seen as a 3D image, a volume or a tensor in ‚Ñù3. The CT is converted and loaded by Sethealth into the GPU,
then a [volume ray casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_ray_casting) algorithm renders a 2D projection into the screen.

Notice that this algoritm needs to **"simulate" a light ray going from the camera all the way to the end of the volume**, and that needs to be computed for **every pixel**
of the screen.

Fortunately, today's GPUs can run this algorithm efficiently in realtime!
These programs are called **shaders**, concretely we are going to write a [fragment shader](https://thebookofshaders.com/01/) using the [GLSL language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language).

A fragment shader is a small program that runs for **each** pixel, taking variables (uniforms), textures and the screen position as input and returning a color (RGBA) as output.

Alright! let's look at the [**max-intensity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_intensity_projection) shader that comes with Sethealth:

```cpp {19-30}
void main() {
  // Internally this function takes all the relevant input and
  // prepares a high level "Ray" struct with all the relevant information
  // for our ray casting, such as: direction, number of steps, delta vector...
  Ray ray = computeRay();

  // Early return if we are outside the volume
  if (ray.outside) {
    // If we are outside the volume, just set color to black (0,0,0,0) and return early.
    gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
    return;
  }

  // Initialize a cursor variable at the start
  vec3 cursor = ray.start;

  float maxValue = 0.0;

  // Walk N steps, advancing our cursor
  // This loop is literaly our ray advancing through the 3D space.
  for (int i = 0; i < ray.steps; i++) {
    // Advance the cursor using delta on each iteration
    cursor += ray.delta;

    // Read the current value from the medical image
    float value = readVolume(cursor);

    // Update maxValue, taking the maximun value
    maxValue = max(value, maxValue);
  }

  // Return the final pixel color based on the maxValue recorded.
  // In this case, we are setting the R(red), G(green) and B(blue) components to the same value (maxValue),
  // so the final color will be greyscaled.

  // This last 1.0, correspond to the Alpha(transparency) component.
  gl_FragColor = vec4(maxValue, maxValue, maxValue, 1.0);
}
```


## Built-in functions
Sethealth provides built-in functions to easily create your own volumetric ray caster on top of the medical data. Since you can focus in writing the
logic of you ray caster instead of preparing all the ray directions and matrix transformations. 

### Ray computeRay()
Return a Ray struct, containing all the ray properties required to perform a ray casting.

```cpp
struct Ray {
  vec3 start;     // start point of the ray caster
  vec3 end;       // end point of the ray caster
  vec3 delta;     // delta vector of each iteration
  vec3 direction; // normalized direction of the eye ray
  int steps;      // number of steps of our ray caster
  bool outside;   // "true" when the ray is outside the volume
};
```

### float readVolume(vec3 cursor)
Returns the normalized pixel value (density) of our volume at the specified 3D point (cursor).

### vec3 readNormal(vec3 cursor)
Returns the normalized [normal vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry)) at the surface of the specified point (cursor).
Since it's a volumetric render, there is not a surface strictly speaking, so the normal is the [gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient) of the volume.

### vec4 readColormap(float density)
It uses the provided "colormap", resolving a volume value to a vector color (RGBA).

### vec4 readColor(vec3 cursor)
This function uses `readVolume()` and `readColormap()` under the hood to return the resolve the color of
a specific 3D point (cursor) using the provided colormap.

### float depthAt(vec3 cursor)
Returns the [non-linear depth](https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Depth-testing) at the specified 3D point.
This value can be passed directly to `gl_FragDepth`. This is used to give our shader depth so it can be integrated with
normal rasterized geometry.
