We have already learned how to us the `<set-view-volumetric>` component to render computed tomographies in 3D.
While this component comes with 3 built-in shaders:

```html
<set-view-volumetric shader="max-intensity"></set-view-volumetric>
```

- `"basic"`
- `"lighting"`
- `"shadows"`
- `"max-intensity"`

Even though this 4 shaders should cover most of the functionality, it's possible to go even more low level
and write some for special use cases or just experimenting new ways to visualize your data.

Sethealth API makes writing this shaders extremelly easy by abstracting aways all the setup required to get 
a production ready ray caster.


## Anatomy of a volumetric ray caster shader

A computed tomography can be seen as a 3D image, a volume or a tensor in ‚Ñù3. This image is loaded by Sethealth into a 3D texture in the GPU,
then a [volume ray casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_ray_casting) algorithm renders a 2D projection into the screen.

Notice that this algoritm needs to "simulate" a light ray going from the camera all the way to end of the volume, and that needs to be computed for **every pixel**
of the screen.

Fortunately today's GPUs can run this algorithm efficiently in realtime!
These programs are called **shaders**, concretely we are going to write a [fragment shader](https://thebookofshaders.com/01/) using the [GLSL language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language).

A fragment shader is small program that runs for **each** pixel in the screen, takes variables (uniforms), textures and the screen position as input and returns a color as output.

Alright! let's look at the [**max-intensity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_intensity_projection) shader:

```cpp {19-30}
void main() {
  // Internally this function takes all the relevant input and
  // prepares a high level "Ray" struct with all the relevant information
  // for our ray casting, such as: direction, number of steps, delta vector...
  Ray ray = computeRay();

  // Early return if we are outside the volume
  if (ray.outside) {
    // If we are outside the volume, just set color to black (0,0,0,0) and return early.
    gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
    return;
  }

  // Initialize a cursor variable at the start
  vec3 cursor = ray.start;

  float maxDensity = 0.0;

  // Walk N steps, advancing our cursor
  // This loop is literaly our ray advancing through the 3D space.
  for (int i = 0; i < ray.steps; i++) {
    // Advance the cursor using delta on each iteration
    cursor += ray.delta;

    // Read the current value from the medical image
    float value = readVolume(cursor);

    // Update maxValue, taking the maximun value
    maxValue = max(value, maxValue);
  }

  // Return the final pixel color based on the maxValue recorded.
  // In this case, we are setting the R(red), G(green) and B(blue) components to the same value (maxValue),
  // so the final color will be greyscaled.

  // This last 1.0, correspond to the Alpha(transparency) component.
  gl_FragColor = vec4(maxValue, maxValue, maxValue, 1.0);
}
```


## Built-in functions
Sethealth provides built-in functions to create your own volumetric ray caster on top of the medical data.

### Ray computeRay()
Creates a Ray struct, containing all the ray properties required to perform a ray casting.

```cpp
struct Ray {
  vec3 start;     // start point of the ray caster
  vec3 end;       // end point of the ray caster
  vec3 delta;     // delta vector of each iteration
  vec3 direction; // normalized direction of the eye ray
  int steps;      // number of steps of our ray caster
  bool outside;   // "true" when the ray is outside the volume
};
```

### float readVolume(vec3 cursor)
Returns the normalized pixel value (density) of our volume at the specified 3D point.

### vec3 readNormal(vec3 cursor)
Returns the normalized normal vector at the specified 3D point.
Normals are computed as the gradient of the volume

### vec4 readColormap(float density)
Resolves the color vector for the specified density value in thee [0, 1].

### vec4 readColor(vec3 cursor)
Resolves the color vector based on the density at the specified 3D point.

### float depthAt(vec3 cursor)
Returns the non-linear depth at the specified 3D point.
This value can be passed directly to gl_FragDepth.
