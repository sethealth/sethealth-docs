Sethealth is not only a medical data visualization tool. In fact, Sethealth API makes
it very easy and safe to share medical data, allowing its users to upload it to the cloud.

In this section you can see how to do it.

## Access token

First of all, in order to upload data and use the cloud services, it's required an access token.
This access token allows the SDK to upload and download data in a safe and controlled way.

Once you generate a token, it must be passed to the SDK using the `auth` module.
```js
await sethealth.auth.setAccessToken(token);
```

Notice that access tokens are short-lived, meaning it expires few hours after its creation, so they must
be generated on-demand in your own backend.

[Learn how to create access tokens from a service account](../dashboard/service-account).


## Uploading data with `ensureSources()`

This method can be called from the `workspace` API and it uploads data only when strictly necesary. This method returns
a `SerializableWorkspace` as under the hood calls to `workspace.serialize()`.

```tsx
import * as sethealth from "@sethealth/core";

const json = await sethealth.workspace.ensureSources({
  workspaces: [myWorkspace];
});
```

This method can be called from `med` or `geometry` too, thus avoiding creating a `Workspace` object.
Under the hood, calling this method form `workspace` uses `med.ensureSources()` and `geometry.ensureSources()`.
If any `MedHandler` or `Geometry` have a source yet, the method will skip.

## Serializing a Workspace with `serialize()`

The `workspace.serialize()` returns a `SerializableWorkspace` given a `Workspace`. A `SerializableWorkspace` is a
JSON-safe serializable object created in order to share a workspace or store it for persistence.

```tsx
import * as sethealth from "@sethealth/core";

const json = await sethealth.workspace.serialize({
  workspace: myWorkspace,
  medSource: url,
});
```

The field `medSource` is not required in order serialize a `Workspace`. If it is not used, the `MedHandler` contained by the
`Workspace` must have a `MedSource` (it can be achive with the `ensureSources()` method). Althought, if you want to serialize
a `Workspace` without a `MedSource` is possible too, specifying a null value in `opts.medSource` that will overwrite the actual
`MedHandler` value. For further information [check out the docs](../modules/workspace).


## Uploading a SerializableWorkspace to _sethealth_ with uploadMetadata()

Using `workspace.serialize()` or `workspace.ensureSources()` will return a `SerializableWorkspace`, but it is not uploaded yet. As mentioned,
a `SerializableWorkspace` is a JSON-safe serializable object so it could be uploaded to _sethealth_ with the `uploadMetadata()` method of the
`storage` API

```tsx
import * as sethealth from "@sethealth/core";

const jsonstring = JSON.stringify(json);
const secret = await sethealth.storage.uploadMetadata(jsonstring);
```

Now this `secret` is a string that contains an URL to share all the files attached.

## Downloading a SerializableWorkspace from _sethealth_ with loadMetadata()

After uploading data, let's see how to download it. With the secret generated before, we will be able to download the `JSON`
that represents a `SerializableWorkspace`.

```tsx
import * as sethealth from "@sethealth/core";

const jsonstring = await sethealth.storage.loadMetadata(secret);
const json = JSON.parse(jsonstring) as SerializableWorkspace;
```

With the `SerializableWorkspace` now it is possible to create again the same `workspace` as before as it contains all the
sources needed to download MedHandler and Geometries attached. To see how [check out to the next fragment](../guides/sharing-data#creating-a-Workspace-from-a-serializableworkspace)


## Creating a Workspace from a SerializableWorkspace

Now let's see how to use a `SerializableWorkspace` to create the `Workspace` again.

```tsx
import * as sethealth from "@sethealth/core";

const result = await sethealth.workspace.loadFromWorkspace(json);
if (result.error) {
  console.error(result.error);
}
const workspace = result.value;
```

First a `MedHandler` should be created as will be used to create the workspace. Then the `Workspace` can be restored by using `workspace.create()`
passing the `MedHandler` and the previously serialized `SerializableWorkspace`. For further information [check out the docs](../modules/workspace).
