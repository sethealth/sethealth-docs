Sethealth is a toolkit that allows developers write healthcare software easier. The services and SDK provided allows you to focus into building a great product, without having to worry about handling all the different medical formats and protocols, making sure data is correctly anonymized and safely encrypted for storage, visualizating, annotating, measuring...

1. Today, the access of Sethealth SDK is only [under invitation](https://sethealth.typeform.com/to/hOvMvs).

2. Install the Sethealth SDK:

```bash
npm install @sethealth/core
```

3. Login into the [Sethealth Dashboard](https://dashboard.set.health)

4. Create a new API key with your deployment domain:

<img alt="Create API key" src={useBaseUrl('docs-img/create-api-key.png')} />

5. Initalize with the API key

```js
import * as sethealth from '@sethealth/core';

async function init() {
    const API_KEY = "YOUR API KEY";
    await sethealth.initialize(API_KEY);
}
```
