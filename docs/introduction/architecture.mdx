Sethealth SDK is split into different modules, all of the working together, but separed by different functionaly.

</div>

## `sethealth.auth`

The `auth` module exposes the `setAccessToken()` method, required in order for sethealth to connect with the sethealth server and provide the storage, and any on-cloud services.

You should always provide a valid access token if your applications expects to use any of this services.

Please [check out the `auth` docs](../modules/auth) for further details about how to obtain a valid access token for testing and production.

## `sethealth.med`

The `med` module is the core of the medical imaging parsing, processing and serialization. This module mainly exposes a set of different methods to handle medical data. Supporting dicom, nifty, nrrd, raw and PNG sets.

The term "med" is used as a generalization of "medical data". With this module you will be able to handle different types and formats of medical images.

Please [check out the `med` docs](../modules/med) for further details about how to load, and work with medical images.

This module does not deal with any kind of UI of visualiazation, continue with the `workspace` module for UI/visualization use cases.

## `sethealth.workspace`

This module allows to create and serialize workspaces. A workspace is a reactive state that references a previously imported `med`. Once a workspace is created, it's passed down to any UI component that supports this property. 

All UI components using the same workspace will share the same `med` and the same state, such as the active `mouse tool`, the current window/level, geometry, annotations.

```jsx
const [med] = await sethealth.med.loadFromSource(...);
const workspace = await sethealth.workspace.create(med);

...

<set-view-slices workspace={workspace}/>
<set-view-volumetric workspace={workspace}/>

...
```

In some way, you can see a workspace as a extra layer of lightweight metadata that is not part of the original volume but it's useful for visualization purposes.

- Geometry
- Anotations
- Measurements
- Segmentations
- Image settings like window/level (contrast/brithness)
- Visible slice
...

Even if you don't need this extra layer of metadata for your app, a workspace is always required in order to visualize a `med` in any of the UI components of sethealth.

Please [checkout the `workspace` docs](../modules/workspace) for further information.

## `sethealth.geometry`

Geometry visualization is built-in in sethealth, using the MIT open source project `three.js`. The `geometry` module allows developers to import external `.stl` files as well as generate new 3D meshes based on an existing `med`.

Once a new `geometry` is loaded, it can be attached to an existing `workspace`, this way a `geometry` can be rendered under the context of a `med`.

Please [check out the `geometry` docs](../modules/geometry) for further information.


## `sethealth.storage`

This module allows developers to upload albitrary payload of data to the sethealth, all end-to-end encrypted.
Sethealth server and staff will never be able to see the content of the uploaded payload.

Most of the times, developers will not need to use this module directly, since storage API are already deeply integrated into the `med`, `workspace` and `geometry` modules, which provides better API ergonomic to safely upload medical data.


## `sethealth.dataset`

This module allows to append data to existing datasets (previously created in the dashboard).
A dataset is a collection of assets and metadata, grouped by cases and studies. Datasets allows clients to easily monitor the amount of data collected and batch download it when required.

A common use case for datasets is to append logical collections of imagens and/or data for later machine learning use cases.

Please [checkout the `dataset` docs](../modules/dataset) for further information.
