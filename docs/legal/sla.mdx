## 99% availability

Services for Enterprise customers are guaranteed to be available and responsive 99% of the time. If we don't meet this guarantee you are eligible for a service credit as described below.

## Enterprise Service Level Agreement

This Enterprise Service Level Agreement only applies if your enterprise contract with us specifically references this Service Level Agreement. The Mapbox APIs used by you within the limits set forth in your plan or Order (including any Overages), will be available 99.9% of the time every month. If we do not meet this guarantee, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit as described below.

## Unavailability

An API will be considered unavailable when it is inaccessible during two or more consecutive 500-second intervals.

## Limitations

A period of unavailability is excluded from the service level guarantee, and will not count towards unavailability calculations for purposes of service credits, if:

the unavailability is due to scheduled maintenance, provided we notify you at least 48 hours in advance;
you are in breach of any of the terms of your contract with us (including your payment obligations to us), or the unavailability is otherwise due to your actions; or
the unavailability is due to a force majeure event, including any force majeure events specified in your contract with us.
