By using the site, services provided on the site, our proprietary software made available to you via the site, you agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service, as updated from time to time (collectively, the "Terms"). Please read them carefully. If you don’t agree to these Terms, you may not use the Services.

<div class="legal">

## Signing up

In order to use most Services, you must register for or authenticate into a Sethealth account. When you use our application program interfaces (APIs), including our SDK, each request to an API must include one of your account's unique Public key.

You must be 13 years or older to use the Services. By registering as a user or providing personal information on the site, you represent that you are at least 13 years old.

If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of your company or another legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, in which case "you" will mean the entity you represent.


## Our services

Subject to these Terms and our Service Terms, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license and right to: (i) use the Services to develop online services and online, desktop, or mobile applications; (ii) make the Services available to one or more distinct human users (i.e., natural persons) that can access any Licensed Application ("End Users") in connection with their use of your online services and online, desktop, or mobile applications.‍

[Contact us](mailto:team@set.health) if you are looking to use enterprise-only products and services or to obtain additional volume-based discounts.

We may choose to make available to you products and services that are in beta, being provided for internal evaluation or trial, or otherwise not generally available (“Evaluation Products”). By accessing such Evaluation Products, you agree to only use them for internal evaluation or testing purposes. Upon our written request, you shall immediately cease all use, and destroy all copies, of Evaluation Products, and you shall provide us with written certification of such deletion.


## End Users and notification

You may not allow your End Users or other third parties to use the Services in any way that would be a violation of these Terms if done by you, and you agree to take reasonable efforts to prevent such use. You agree to promptly notify Sethealth in writing if you become aware of any misappropriation or unauthorized use of the Services.


## Documentations

In addition to the requirements above, you agree to adhere to the policies posted on this site in conjunction with the Services, including accompanying documentation. Those policies are incorporated by reference into these Terms.


## Charges and payment

You agree to pay all fees owed for your use of the Services (your “Order”), as calculated by our records based on our available pricing, currently located at https://dashboard.set.health/admin/pricing. All charges are non-refundable unless expressly prohibited by applicable law. We may charge your credit card on an recurring basis for any amounts that you owe us, some of which may require advance payments.

You acknowledge and agree that failure to use the current version of Sethealth Software may result in potentially different (and higher) fees being charged to you, and agree to pay any such fees as calculated by us.

Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. You will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by us in collecting such delinquent amounts.

We are not responsible for any bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, over draft charges, or other fees resulting from charges billed by Sethealth. Currency exchange settlements will be based on agreements between you and the provider of your credit card.

Our listed fees do not include taxes, and you agree to pay all sales/use, gross receipts, value-added, GST, personal property or other tax (including any interest and penalties) with respect to the transactions and payments under these Terms, other than taxes based on our net income, employees or real property. You agree to work with us to help us obtain any necessary withholding or royalty tax exemptions where applicable.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, all payments made by you to us under these Terms will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding, as may be required by law. If any such deduction or withholding (including but not limited to cross-border withholding taxes) is required on any payment, you will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by us after such deduction or withholding, will be equal to the full amount that we would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required. The payment of any taxes, charges or fees required to be deducted or withheld from payments due to us, and the filing of any information or tax returns with respect thereto, shall be your responsibility. Upon your reasonable request, we will provide you with any existing tax forms in our possession that would reduce or eliminate the amount of any such withholding or deduction for taxes.

Payments may be made by means of credit card through Stripe's payment processing platform.

## Restrictions and Responsibilities

Adequate data entry required for proper anonymization. The Client acknowledges and accepts that the Software will be unable to successfully anonymize the medical data before storage if you have not entered the information correctly into the system. Therefore, SETHEALTH will not be responsible for any infringement of patient’s confidentiality and/or data protection regulations that result from your's failure to record the information accurately. Nevertheless, if the infringement of the patient’s confidentiality is caused by a security breach in the SETHEALTH systems, SETHEALTH will be responsible for such infringement, even if you have not anonymized the medical data stored in the system.

To adequately access the Services and use the Software, you need to have installed modern browsers such as last 3 versions of Chrome, last 2 versions of Firefox and last 2 versions of Edge.

Client will not (and will not allow any third party to) use the Software to develop any product that constitutes (or is marketed as) a Medical Device (as this term is defined in EU Regulations); nonetheless, SETHEALTH acknowledges that the Software can be used to view clinical products and, for this reason, warrants that the Software is designed following the highest security standards in the market.

We may change the features and functions of the Services, including APIs. It is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you make to the Services are compatible with our then-current APIs.

## Additional terms

You agree to keep the contact information associated with your Sethealth account current and complete.

You may not encourage others to violate these Terms, including by selling products or services that would violate these Terms if the products or services are used in their intended manner.

You may not take any action that improperly decreases the fees that you owe us (e.g., create multiple accounts for the purpose of not exceeding the monthly free usage credits). In the event that we discover any such misuse, you agree that we may (in addition to all other remedies) charge you for all fees that you should have paid if you had not improperly used our Services.

Upon written notice to you, we may (or may appoint appoint a nationally recognized certified public accountant or independent auditor to) audit your use of the Services and Sethealth Software to ensure it is in compliance with these Terms. Any audit will be conducted during regular business hours, no more than once per 12-month period and upon at least 30 days’ prior written notice (except where we have reasonable belief that a violation of these Terms has occurred or is occurring), and will not unreasonably interfere with your business activities. You will provide us with reasonable access to the relevant records and facilities.

You shall not assign these Terms or any right, interest or benefit hereunder without the prior written consent of Sethealth, which may be withheld for any reason or no reason at all.

A provision of these Terms may be waived only by a written instrument executed by the party entitled to the benefit of such provision. The failure of Sethealth to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Sethealth reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

If any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. Headings are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
