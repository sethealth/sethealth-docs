---

Once you know how to load medical data, you may want to visualize it.

In this case, Sethealth has some types of tomography visualizations. Thanks to some custom components, sethealth provides an easy
and fancy visualization creation.

## Workspace

Here one main concept have to be highlighted: `workspace`s are the ones in charge of sharing the medical data loaded between components.
All these components have a field called `workspace` where a `WorkspaceState` value should be placed.
This is created as follows:

```tsx
import * as sethealth from "@sethealth/core";

const handlers: MedHandler[] = await sethealth.med.loadFromSource({
  type: "nrrd",
  input:
    "https://public1-eu-sethealth.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/public/ankle.nrrd.gz",
});
const medicalData: MedHandler = handlers[0];
const myWorkpsace: WorkspaceState = sethealth.workspace.create(medicalData);
```

Now with this workspace the MedHandler can be shared between different components and they are syncronized.

The workspace can be created from a `MedHandler` as above. Also, a workspace can be loaded from a `SerializableWorkspace`.
For further information, you can check the `workspace` API.

## View tomography slices

Once we have a workspace we can use it to visualize the medical data.

```tsx
<SetViewSlices projection="axial" workspace={myWorkpsace}></SetViewSlices>
```

As above, visualization can be done with the component `<SetViewSlices>`. The value of its option `projection` defines the
projection wich is going to be shown: `axial`, `coronal` or `sagital`. For further information, [check out the `<SetViewSlices>`
component docs](../components/set-view-slices).

### Example

Here you can see and edit a complete example:

<iframe
  src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/view-tomography-slices?embed=1&file=App.tsx&hideExplorer=1&hideNavigation=1"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
></iframe>

## View tomography in 3d

Other kind of visualization is the 3D rendering of a tomography. This 3D model can be reached as follows.

```tsx
<SetViewVolumetric workspace={myWorkpsace}> </SetViewVolumetric>
```

As shown above, the same workspace is used. This component will render a 3D model of the same tomography. In the docs more
information is available: [click here for further information](../components/set-view-volumetric).

### Example

Here you can see and edit a complete example:

<iframe
  src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/view-tomography-3d?embed=1&file=App.tsx&hideExplorer=1&hideNavigation=1"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
></iframe>

## View grid panel

Once all the visualizations have been explained, let's see all at the same time.
The code you would use is:

```tsx
<SetGridPanel>
  <SetPane viewId="1" type={"slices-axial"} workspace={myWorkpsace} />
  <SetPane viewId="2" type={"volumetric"} workspace={myWorkpsace} />
  <SetPane viewId="3" type={"slices-sagital"} workspace={myWorkpsace} />
  <SetPane viewId="4" type={"slices-coronal"} workspace={myWorkpsace} />
</SetGridPanel>
```

Sethealth provides a component, `<SetGridPanel>`, that creates a `grid` where you could use more than one
visualizers. Furthermore, these visualizers would be syncronized due to they are sharing the same workspace.
To see how to personalize this component, [check out their docs](../components/set-grid-panel).

Say that `<SetPane>` is a generic component for `<SetViewVolumetric>` and `<SetViewSlices>`.

<iframe

  width="100%"
  height="600px"
></iframe>
