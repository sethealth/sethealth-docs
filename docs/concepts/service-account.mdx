A service account is a special kind of account used by an application instead of by a person.
Applications use service accounts to make authorized API calls. 

The only use case of a service account is to generate access tokens that can be later used by
the Sethealth SDK in order to perform authorized requests, such as uploading data to the server.

```js
import * as sethealth from '@sethealth/core;'

const token = "ACCESS_TOKEN";
sethealth.auth.setAccessToken(token);
``` 

<img alt="Example service-account" style={{borderRadius:"5px"}} src={useBaseUrl('docs-img/service-account.png')} />

On the dashboard, a service account is shown like the one above. As you can see, every
service account starts with the prefix "sa" followed by a numeric id and in the end, the team
it belongs to. To use a service account you must use the entire id (prefix and suffix included).


### Create a service account

In order to create a service account, [go to the dashboard and click the button that says "Create Service Account"](https://dashboard.set.health/admin/service-accounts).

Once the modal appears, the only field needed is the service account's name, likely the application
name which is going to use it. Then fill the field in the modal shown below and press `Create` button to confirm.

<div style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
    <img alt="Create service-account modal" style={{maxWidth:"300px", borderRadius:"5px"}} src={useBaseUrl('docs-img/service-account-create-2.png')} />
</div>

Then you will have created the service account. Nowadays sethealth has support for python and golang clients.

### Using service account

Once you have created the service account, the following modal will be shown:

<div style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
    <img alt="service-account-created-modal" style={{maxWidth:"400px", borderRadius:"5px"}} src={useBaseUrl('docs-img/service-account-created.png')} />
</div>

In the modal, `SETHEALTH_SECRET` and `SETHEALTH_KEY` are enviroment variables you should be accesible from your server-side application.
Once the service account credentials are property configured in your server, you can install one of your **server clients** and generate access token on demand.

<Tabs
groupId="server"
defaultValue="go"
values={[
    {label: 'Golang', value: 'go'},
    {label: 'Python', value: 'py'},
]}>
<TabItem value="go">

[Check out the Golang docs](https://github.com/sethealth/sethealth-go)

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/sethealth/sethealth-go"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new sethealth client with the service account credentials
    client := sethealth.New()

    // Ask for a short-living access token
    token, err := client.GetToken()
    fmt.Println("ACCESS TOKEN", token.Token)
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="py">

[Check out the Python docs](https://github.com/sethealth/sethealth-python)

```python
import sethealth

# Create sethealth client
client = sethealth.Client()

# Ask for a short-living access token
token = client.getToken()
print("ACCESS TOKEN: " + token)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::caution
Once the modal is closed, the `SETHEALTH_SECRET` will not be accesible again for security reasons.
:::

:::danger
Never hard-code the service account credentials (API key/secret) in a client-side application. This credentials are long-lived and should be kept secret
in your backend.
:::


### Generating a testing token

Pressing the `test access token`, generates a short-lived access token. It is analogous to calling the method `getToken()` in the API.

<div style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
    <img alt="service-account-created-modal" style={{borderRadius:"5px"}} src={useBaseUrl('docs-img/service-account-test-token.png')} />
</div>

This might be helpful when you need to test your application without a backend.

:::caution
Remember that access tokens must also be kept secret and they are short-lived, you should never hard code an access token
into your application, since they expire very offen. Instead, your backend should use the Golang/Python clients to generate them on-demand.
:::


### Using a access token 

As mentioned in the [sharing data guide](../guides/sharing-data), the access token is required by the
SDK to upload data to the cloud.

```js
const token = await callMyBackend();
await sethealth.auth.setAccessToken(token);
```
