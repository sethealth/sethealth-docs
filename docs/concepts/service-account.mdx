A service account is a special kind of account used by an application instead of by a person.
Applications use service accounts to make authorized API calls. A team can handle more
than a service account, depending on how many applications it has running.

On the dashboard, a service account is shown like the one above. As you can see, every
service account starts with the prefix "sa" followed by a numeric id and in the end, the team
it belongs to. To use a service account you must use the entire id (prefix and suffix included).

### Create a service account

First of all, to create a service-account, you need to click the button shown below.

<img alt="Create service-account" style={{borderRadius:"5px"}} src={useBaseUrl('docs-img/service-account-create-1.png')} />

Once the modal appears, the only field needed is the service account's name, likely the application
name which is going to use it. Then fill the field in the modal shown below and press `Create` button to confirm.

<div style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
    <img alt="Create service-account modal" style={{maxWidth:"300px", borderRadius:"5px"}} src={useBaseUrl('docs-img/service-account-create-2.png')} />
</div>

Then you will have created the service account. Nowadays sethealth has support for python and golang clients.

### Using service account

Once you have created the service account, the following modal will be shown:

<div style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
    <img alt="service-account-created-modal" style={{maxWidth:"400px", borderRadius:"5px"}} src={useBaseUrl('docs-img/service-account-created.png')} />
</div>

In the modal, `SETHEALTH_SECRET` and `SETHEALTH_KEY` are enviroment variables you should either export or include in your application in some other way.
After storing your enviroment variables, you should install the client package and use the code displayed in order to initialize the client.

**IMPORTANT**: Once you close the modal, the `SETHEALTH_SECRET` will not be accesible again!


### Testing token

Pressing the `test access token`, an access token will be generated. It is analgo to calling the method `getToken()` in the API.

<div style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
    <img alt="service-account-created-modal" style={{borderRadius:"5px"}} src={useBaseUrl('docs-img/service-account-test-token.png')} />
</div>

Using it is very helpfull when you are testing your application. However, this value should not be in your code as it should not be read by others.
