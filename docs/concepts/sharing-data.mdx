Sethealth is not only a medical data visualization tool. In fact, Sethealth API provides in its modules some tools to
share medical data allowing its users to upload it to the cloud. In this section you can see how to do it.

## Uploading data


## Uploading data with ensureSources()

This method can be called from the `workspace` API and it uploads data only when strictly necesary.

```tsx
import * as sethealth from "@sethealth/core";

await sethealth.workspace.ensureSources({
  workspaces: [myWorkspace];
});
```

This method can be called from `med` or `geometry` too, thus avoiding creating a `WorkspaceState` object.
Under the hood, calling this method form `workspace` uses `med.ensureSources()` and `geometry.ensureSources()`.
If any `MedHandler` or `GeometryModel` have a source yet, the method will skip.

## Serializing a WorkspaceState with serialize()

The `workspace.serialize()` returns a `SerializableWorkspace` given a `WorkspaceState`. A `SerializableWorkspace` is a
JSON-safe serializable object created in order to share a workspace or store it for persistence.

```tsx
import * as sethealth from "@sethealth/core";

const json = await sethealth.workspace.serialize({
  workspace: myWorkspace,
  medSource: url,
});
```

The field `medSource` is not required in order serialize a `WorkspaceState`. If it is not used, the `MedHandler` contained by the
`WorkspaceState` must have a `MedSource` (it can be achive with the `ensureSources()` method). Althought, if you want to serialize
a `WorkspaceState` without a `MedSource` is possible too, specifying a null value in `opts.medSource` that will overwrite the actual
`MedHandler` value. For further information [check out the docs](../modules/workspace).

## Creating a WorkspaceState from a SerializableWorkspace

Now let's see how to use a `SerializableWorkspace` to create the `WorkspaceState` again.

```tsx
import * as sethealth from "@sethealth/core";

const workspace = await sethealth.workspace.loadFromWorkspace(json);
```

First a `MedHandler` should be created as will be used to create the workspace. Then the `WorkspaceState` can be restored by using `workspace.create()`
passing the `MedHandler` and the previously serialized `SerializableWorkspace`. For further information [check out the docs](../modules/workspace).
