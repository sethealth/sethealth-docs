title: Loading Medical Data
---

The first thing you might want to do with Sethealth is to load medical data into the system.

Sethealth exposes all the `medical` data APIs in the `med` module. This module exposes a set of different APIs to load 
medical from different sources and formats.

The main API is `med.loadFromSource(source: MedSource)`. This function takes a config object that specifis the source's input and the format
of the data, for the moment, *sethealth* supports the following formats:

- `"dicom"`
- `"nrrd"`
- `"nifty"`
- `"png"`
- `"raw"`

## Loading from source

Here's an example of how to load a NRRD file from a URL source:

```tsx
import * as sethealth from '@sethealth/core';

const handlers = await sethealth.med.loadFromSource({
    type: 'dicom',
    input: 'https://public1-eu-sethealth.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/public/ankle.nrrd.gz'
});

const medicalData = handlers[0];
console.log(medicalData);
```

As you can see, this API returns an array of handlers, each one is potentially a different medical resource.
This can happen because a single source might contain more than one image.

Now with `medicalData` you can do all sorts of things, such as, getting the raw pixels, quering the dicom for different
metadata, compute the image histogram, visualize it... please refer to the `med` module docs to see all.


## Loading a local filesystem

Sethealth includes a convenient API in order to load medical images from the local filesyste:

```tsx
import * as sethealth from '@sethealth/core';

const handlers = await sethealth.med.loadFromFilesystem();
const medicalData = handlers[0];
console.log(medicalData);
```

This API will show a file selection dialog that the user can use to import medical data from their local computer.

Analogously to the `loadFromSource()` API, this API also returns an array of medical resources.


## <SetFileLoader/>

Since loading medical data from the local system is an extremelly common use case, sethealth also includes a component
that handles the whole process.

Under the hood, `<SetFileLoader/>` uses the same APIs exposed in the `med` but also provides an extra value by:

- Showing a file selection dialog when clicked
- Displaying a drag-and-drop area for users to load medical data easily
- Display the correct progress bar while the data is being loaded.


```jsx
<SetFileLoader
    type="med"
    onSetMedLoad={this.onMedLoad}
>
    Drop your medical files here
</SetFileLoader>
```

As you can see in the example above, a `type` and an event handler is passed down.

The `type` specifies which kind of resource this component is intended to load. By default it's `"med"`, however,
this components can also be used to load other kind of assets:

### Type values:

- **"med"**: loading a medical files (dicoms, nifty, nrrd)
- **"geometry"**: 3d model files, such as the .stl format.
- **"files"**: any file, this component will load the file without trying to parse it. 


### Events

Once this component loads some medical data (after some user interaction), it emits the `setMedLoad` event,
which includes the same array of handlers that `loadFromSource()` and `loadFromFilesystem()`.

```ts
private async onMedLoad(ev: CustomEvent<FileLoadDetail<MedHandler>>) {
    const handlers = ev.detail.items;
    const medicalData = handlers[0]:
    console.log(medicalData);
}
```
