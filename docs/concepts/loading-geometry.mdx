title: Loading Geometry
---

Once you know how to load and visualize medical data, let's see another sethealth funcionality.

Sethealth's `geometry` module could be used to manage geometry models, for example, the ones that can be stored in a `"stl"` file.
This module exposes a set of different APIs to load geometries.

The main API is `geometry.loadFromSource(source: GeometrySource)`. Nowadays sethealth supports the `"stl"` format.

## Loading from source

Here's an example of how to load a `stl` file from a URL source:

```tsx
import * as sethealth from "@sethealth/core";

const geometry: sethealth.GeometryModel = await sethealth.geometry.loadFromSource(
  {
    type: "stl",
    input:
      "https://public1-eu-sethealth.ams3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/public/geometry/fibula.stl.gz",
  }
);
```

## Loading a local filesystem

Sethealth includes a convenient API in order to load geometries from the local filesystem:

```tsx
import * as sethealth from "@sethealth/core";

const geometries: sethealth.GeometryModel[] = await sethealth.med.loadFromFilesystem();
```

This API will show a file selection dialog that the user can use to import medical data from their local computer.

Unlike the `loadFromSource()` API, this API returns an array of geometries as you can select more than one `"stl"` file.

## <SetFileLoader/>

Since loading geometries from the local system is an extremelly common use case, sethealth also includes a component
that handles the whole process.

Under the hood, `<SetFileLoader/>` uses the same APIs exposed in the `geometry` module but also provides an extra value by:

- Showing a file selection dialog when clicked
- Displaying a drag-and-drop area for users to load data easily
- Display the correct progress bar while the data is being loaded.

```jsx
<SetFileLoader type="geometry" workspace={myWorkspace}>
  Drop your files here
</SetFileLoader>
```

As you can see in the example above, a `type` and an event handler is passed down.

The `type` specifies which kind of resource this component is intended to load. By default it's `"med"`, however,
this components can also be used to load other kind of assets:

### Type values:

- **"med"**: loading a medical files (dicoms, nifty, nrrd)
- **"geometry"**: 3d model files, such as the .stl format.
- **"files"**: any file, this component will load the file without trying to parse it.

Unlike when medical data is loaded, when `type="geometry"` is used we need to specify a `workspace` to work with.
Without doing anything, these geometries loaded will be appended to the `workspace.models` array.

### Events

Once this component loads some geometries (after some user interaction), it emits the `setGeometryLoad` event,
which includes the same array of goemetries as `loadFromFilesystem()`.

```ts
import * as sethealth from "@sethealth/core";

private async onGeometryLoad(ev: CustomEvent<FileLoadDetail<GeometryModel>>) {
    const geometries: sethealth.GeometryModel[] = ev.detail.items;
    const geometry: sethealth.GeometryModel = geometries[0]:
    console.log(geometry);
}
```
