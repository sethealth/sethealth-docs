## What are datasets?
 A dataset is an entity that allows you to logically aggregate data in order to later be analyzed 
 or used for machine learning workflows.

<img alt="Example dataset" style={{borderRadius:"5px"}} src={useBaseUrl('docs-img/dataset.png')} />

On the dashboard, a dataset is shown like the one above. As you can see, every
dataset starts with the prefix "ds" followed by a numeric id. To access to a dataset,
you must use the entire id (prefix included).

 ### Create a dataset
First of all, to create a dataset, you need to click the button shown below.

<img alt="Create dataset" style={{borderRadius:"5px"}} src={useBaseUrl('docs-img/dataset-create-1.png')} />

Once the modal appears, a name and description must be provided in order to distinguish it from others.
Once you fill the name and description, press the button `Create dataset`.

<div style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
    <img alt="Create dataset modal" style={{maxWidth:"400px", borderRadius:"5px"}} src={useBaseUrl('docs-img/dataset-create-2.png')} />
</div>

After that, the dataset is ready to be used.

### Append to dataset

In the sethealth API exists a module called `dataset`. This module provides a method `get` which retrieves a `Dataset` instnce
to handle the dataset created. Once you have the instance, you can easily upload assets with the `append` method.

```tsx
import * as sethealth from "@sethealth/core";

const myDataset = await sethealth.dataset.get("ds-5681747056394240");
const opts: DatasetOptions = {
    caseID: "<case-id>";
        entries: [{
            type: "<type>";
            payload: "<payload>";
            size: `<size>`;
        }];

};
myDataset.append(opts);
```

The append method, as you can see above, needs some options. These options are:

  - `caseID`: (optional) Identier of the case. If not filled, a new identier would be generated.
  - `entries`: The data that will be appended to the dataset. Every entry has the following fields:
    - `type`: Type of the entry. For example "tomography" or "csv".
    - `payload`: The source of the data appended. For example an URL to download the entry data.
    - `size`: (optional) The approximate size of the file that will be downloaded.
