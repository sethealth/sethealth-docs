## What are buckets?

A bucket is an entity that allows you to store assets sith a determined expiration date and an availability.
The difference between availability and storage expiration date lies in the ease of access to data.

<div style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
    <img alt="bucket" style={{borderRadius:"5px"}} src={useBaseUrl('docs-img/bucket.png')} />
</div>


 ### Create a buckets

First of all, to create a bucket, you need to click the button shown below.

<img alt="Create dataset" style={{borderRadius:"5px"}} src={useBaseUrl('docs-img/bucket-create-1.png')} />

Once the modal appears, all the bucket options must be filled or selected.

  - `Name`: Bucket's name
  - `Description`: Bucket's description
  - `Storage location`: Where the bucket is going to be physically located
  - `Availability`: How long are the bucket's data going to be easily accesible in months.
  - `Long-term storage`: How long are the bucket's data going to be stored in years.
  - `Compliance`: If true, the data cannot be altered. Not even with an admin role.

<div style={{textAlign:"center"}}>
    <img alt="Create dataset modal" style={{maxWidth:"400px", borderRadius:"5px"}} src={useBaseUrl('docs-img/dataset-create-2.png')} />
</div>

After that, the bucket is ready to be used.

### Upload to bucket

Once the bucket is created, with its ID you will be able to upload assets to it. `Sethealth` API provides more than one way to
upload data. All these methods have an option called `bucketID`. Using this field, you can chose a bucket where upload the data to.

```tsx
import * as sethealth from "@sethealth/core";

const medHandler = await sethealth.med.loadFromFilesystem()[0];
medHandler.upload({  
    public: true;
    bucketID: "bu-5669122872442880";
    allowSensibleData: true;
});
```
In the previous example, some medical files are loaded from the user's filesystem. Then, to these files, some medHandlers are assigned
dynamically (one handler for each case). In this case let's suppose that only one case is selected, and only a MedHandler will be created.
Then, with this MedHandler, upload() method is called to the bucket whose ID is specified.
